A diff made it much easier because the +++s and ---s showed me where to focus in.

If I had access to the entire history of a file, I would easily be able to fix broken code, understand what others had done, and revert away changes that didn't work out.

Manually committing definitely puts the onus on the developer to figure out what is meaningful, but seems like it could lead to careless errors.  Auto could lead to too much noice, and uncompilable code.

Version control for multiple files together makes a lot of sense if there is interdependence, like in coding.  Less needed in docs, so Google Docs doesn't need it.

I can use git log to understand the entire history of changes, and the git diff to see the specific differences between any two files.

If I know that I can always revert, I can more easily feel free to experiment.

Now that my workspace is set up, I want to use git for monitoring the Swerve project.
