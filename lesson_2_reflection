When you initialize a repository, a .git file is created tracking the repo.  You need to do this to let git know to treat the folder as a repo.

A staging area is different from both the working directory and the repo.  It holds the files that you intend to bundle into a commit but haven't yet.  It lets you think through logical groupings.
