When you initialize a repository, a .git file is created tracking the repo.  You need to do this to let git know to treat the folder as a repo.

A staging area is different from both the working directory and the repo.  It holds the files that you intend to bundle into a commit but haven't yet.  It lets you think through logical groupings.

I can use the staging area to make sure that I am being methodical about my commits.

Branches are super helpful when you want to fork off and work on something while preserving your main line of code.

Commit diagrams make it clear how the branches relate to each other.

Merging two branches gives you the combined work in both.

Automatic merging is super convenient when it's obvious, but the manual override in times of uncertainty makes a ton of sense.
